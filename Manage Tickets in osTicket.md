**Manage Tickets in osTicket**

**Introduction**

This section guides you through the process of creating, triaging, and resolving mock tickets within osTicket. These actions demonstrate the practical use of osTicket in managing day-to-day support requests.

**Step 1: Creating Tickets**

- **From User Interface:**
  - Users can create tickets by accessing the client interface via **http://<Your-VM-IP>**.
  - Click on **Open a New Ticket**.
  - Fill out the ticket form, providing details such as the type of issue, description, and any relevant attachments.
  - Submit the form to create the ticket.
- **From Agent Interface:**
  - Agents can create tickets on behalf of users by navigating to the Agent Panel (**http://<Your-VM-IP>/scp**).
  - Go to **Tickets > Open New Ticket**.
  - Complete the required fields similarly to how a user would and submit the ticket.

**Step 2: Viewing and Assigning Tickets**

- Access the Agent Panel.
- Click on **Tickets** to view all incoming tickets.
- Tickets can be assigned manually by clicking on the ticket to open it, then selecting an agent or a team from the **Assign to** dropdown menu.
- Optionally, configure automatic ticket assignment rules under **Admin Panel > Manage > Help Topics** to streamline the process.

**Step 3: Responding to Tickets**

- Open a ticket by clicking on it from the ticket queue.
- Use the **Reply** option to respond directly to the user.
- You can also use the **Internal Note** option to communicate with other agents or teams within the organization without the client seeing these notes.

**Step 4: Triaging Tickets**

- During ticket review, assess the issue's urgency and complexity.
- Update the ticket's status, priority, and department if necessary, to reflect its triage status.
- Set due dates and follow-up tasks within the ticket details.

**Step 5: Resolving and Closing Tickets**

- Once the issue described in the ticket is resolved, go to the ticket in the Agent Panel.
- Provide a final summary of the resolution in the reply section.
- Change the ticket status to **Resolved** or **Closed**.
- Notify the user of the resolution and ensure they are satisfied with the service provided.

**Step 6: Analyzing Ticket Data**

- Use the **Dashboard** and **Reports** features in the Agent Panel to analyze ticket data.
- Generate reports on ticket volume, agent performance, and resolution times to improve service efficiency.

**Conclusion**

By effectively creating, managing, and resolving tickets, you ensure that your osTicket system efficiently handles support requests, enhances user satisfaction, and maintains organized operations. This practical experience is invaluable in understanding and utilizing the full capabilities of the osTicket system.
