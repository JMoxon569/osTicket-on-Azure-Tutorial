# Install osTicket on Azure VM

## Introduction

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to install osTicket, a popular open-source ticketing system, on a virtual machine hosted in Microsoft Azure. We will start by setting up a new virtual machine and then proceed to install and configure osTicket.

## Prerequisites

- An active Microsoft Azure account.
- Basic familiarity with Azure services, especially Virtual Machines.
- Access to SSH or RDP tools, depending on the operating system you choose.

## Steps to Install osTicket

### Step 1: Create and Configure Your Azure Virtual Machine

#### 1.1 Log in to the Azure Portal

Navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and sign in with your credentials.

#### 1.2 Create a New Virtual Machine

- Go to **Virtual machines** in the sidebar and click on **+ Create**.
- Choose your desired OS (Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS for Linux setups, or Windows Server for Windows setups).
- Fill in the details such as VM name, region, availability options, and size. A B1s size is sufficient for demonstration purposes but consider a more robust size for production.
- Set up authentication type (recommend SSH keys for Linux, Username and password for Windows).
- Configure networking settings to ensure the VM can be accessed over the internet.
- Click **Review + create** once all configurations are set, then click **Create**.

#### 1.3 Access the VM

- Once the VM is deployed, go to the resource and note down the public IP address.
- Connect to your VM using SSH (Linux) or Remote Desktop (Windows).

### Step 2: Install osTicket

#### For Windows:

##### 2.1 Install XAMPP or WAMP

- Install XAMPP or WAMP to manage Apache, MySQL, and PHP. These tools provide an all-in-one server solution that includes all the necessary components to run osTicket.

#### 2.2 Download osTicket

- Navigate to the [osTicket official download page](https://osticket.com/download/) and download the latest version of osTicket.
- Upload the download package to your VM and extract it to your web server's root directory (e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs` for XAMPP).

#### 2.3 Configure the Database

- Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start the MySQL service.
- Access phpMyAdmin from the XAMPP Control Panel or by visiting `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` in your web browser.
- Log in to your MySQL database:
    ```bash
    mysql -u root -p
    ```
- Create a new database for osTicket:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE osticket;
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON osticket.* TO 'osticketuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YourPasswordHere';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    EXIT;
    ```

#### 2.4 Run the osTicket Installer

- Open your web browser and go to `http://<Your-VM-IP>/setup/`.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to configure osTicket. This will involve setting up the database connection with the details you created and configuring primary settings.
- Once installation is complete, remove the setup directory for security:
    ```bash
    sudo rm -rf /var/www/html/setup/
    ```

### Conclusion

You have successfully installed osTicket on your Azure virtual machine. You can now proceed to configure your ticketing system according to your organization's needs.
